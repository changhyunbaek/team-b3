    <h3> A Tale of 2 Stocks: Tech Shows Consistent Growth While Auto Manufacturing Companies Bring Much Lower Returns</h3>
    <p> The below graph shows stock prices for 10 of the top companies in the autonomous vehicle industry. Sure, the moral of the story is that tech companies are performing well. Seriously, you should be looking for reasons not to go in on FANG stock. </p>

    <p>However, this is an article on autonomous vehicles, not tech in general. Google stock gets massive support because it is thriving in the data broker economy, but it is very likely that there are going to be winners and losers in this race to an autonomous vehicle. If you are curious about where the tech is on this, please see <a href="../pages/whoswinning.html">who we think is winning</a> this race. For the rest of this article, we want to help you understand the non-tech factors that impact these stocks. </p>

    <div id="chart-container-multiline"> </div>


    <h2>Tesla: More Entertainment Than Returns</h2>
    <h4> Tesla has been fairly good, but you should be scared of low gas prices and Elon Musk</h4>


      <p>Tesla is at the forefront of autonomous vehicles. When you ask the normal person about AV's, people will probably bring up the new Tesla. There are even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXls4cdEv7c">viral videos of their drivers sleeping in rush hour traffic</a>. However, their bread and butter is still with the electric vehicle technology. With this, there are clear trends that low gas prices are not good for Tesla. In 2016, their stock was at its lowest prices in years while gas prices in the US (shown in the second chart) hit their lowest prices since 2004. Unsurprisingly, not many are clamoring to get the newest electric vehicle when gas hits a buck fifty per gallon.</p> 

      <p>Tesla has a second concern: Elon Musk. There's a few to choose from here, but this is probably the most recent and problematic from a legal perspective:</p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2018</a></blockquote>
        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

      <p> This August 2018 tweet single-handedly jacked up the price to $379. But then, red line #2 for Tesla stock pulled the stock down to $250 and <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-is-sinking-as-elon-musks-tweet-is-reportedly-under-investigation-1537289984">Elon got a nice SEC investigation</a>.</p>

    <h2>Nvidia: The AI & Hardware Company Driving the Market has been Golden for Investors</h2>
    <h4>Between 2016 and October 2018, Nvidia Gave Stockholders a 10X Return</h4>

    <p>Unfortunately, that bubble burst. On November 16, 2018, Nvidia's market cap went down $23 billion, or 19% of its total value. The company actually <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-stock-sees-worst-day-in-a-decade-as-more-than-half-of-analysts-cut-price-targets-on-crypto-chip-hangover-2018-11-16">blamed falling cryptocurrency prices for its lack of sales</a>. As related, side advice, if a company's sales is directly tied to the crypto economy, that is probably not a good company to invest in.</p>

    <p>The market has since adjusted in a major way. If you didn't already own Invidia stock, this loss has the potential to turn into a serious gain. Nvidia is currently en route to being the operating system for many of the major auto manufacturers. Tesla and Toyota are currently employing its software to run autonomous systems in their newest cars. Consider this a valuable stock if you believe the self-driving technology is more important that the actual manufacturer of the car.</p>

    <h2>Ferrari: Anti-Autonomous and Showing Major Growth. Other Manufacturers Reliably Stagnant.</h2>
    <h4>Autonomous vehicles are going to change the economy in a lot of ways. At least so far, the winning auto manufacturer is <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/news/14895/ferrari-says-no-thanks-to-autonomous-or-fully-electric-cars">the one campaigning against tech</a>.</h4>
    <p>That seems premature though. And realistically, only Ferrari could pull off that stance. They make a higher end products for a niche consumer segment. It seems that they're okay with this. No trucking companies are going to be switching to autonomous Ferrari semi-trucks. Ferrari knows that. So why would they spend billions trying to figure out deep learning?</p>

    <p>The other companies are not so lucky. They know that they are all fighting for the same consumers and will need to invest like crazy to get some kind of autonomous cars onto the road first. These trends are actually reflected in the market as well. For now, increases come with a new tech partnership or acquisition. But very soon, these will come when actual cars come to their dealerships. If you want to invest in these companies, it is very important to make sure you are following <a href="../pages/whoswinning.html">who's winning.</a>
